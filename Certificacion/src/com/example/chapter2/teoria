-------Encapsulamiento
Encapsulamiento permite mantener una API o una Interfaz de clase limpia y que puede 
modificable con el tiempo.

Los atributos se deben proteger mediante los modificadores private y protected en
conjunción con setters y getters para mantener encapsulamiento.

Una de las ventajas del encapsulamiento es permitir modificar la implementacion de 
una clase sin tener que cambiar el código que la usa.

--------Herencia
* Permite reutilizar código.
* Permite el polimorfismo.

--------XXX
* Entre más sea especializado el código es más problable que se pueda reutilizar.
* Los metodos abstractos deben ser sobrescritos por las clases concretas.
* Cuando un método sobrescibe otro no puede tener un modificador de acceso más 
	restrictivo que el método que sobrescribe.
	Ej: class Padre{ public void algo()} 
		class Hijo extends Padre{ protected void algo()} //Esto no compila.

--------Overriding
The rules for overriding a method are as follows:
* The argument list must exactly match that of the overridden method. If they
don't match, you can end up with an overloaded method you didn't intend.

* The return type must be the same as, or a subtype of, the return type declared
in the original overridden method in the superclass. (More on this in a few
pages when we discuss covariant returns.)

* The access level can't be more restrictive than the overridden method's.

* The access level CAN be less restrictive than that of the overridden method.

* Instance methods can be overridden only if they are inherited by the subclass.
A subclass within the same package as the instance's superclass can override
any superclass method that is not marked private or final. A subclass in a
different package can override only those non-final methods marked public
or protected (since protected methods are inherited by the subclass).

* The overriding method CAN throw any unchecked (runtime) exception,
regardless of whether the overridden method declares the exception. (More
in Chapter 5.)

* The overriding method must NOT throw checked exceptions that are new
or broader than those declared by the overridden method. For example, a
method that declares a FileNotFoundException cannot be overridden by a
method that declares a SQLException, Exception, or any other non-runtime
exception unless it's a subclass of FileNotFoundException.

* The overriding method can throw narrower or fewer exceptions. Just because
an overridden method "takes risks" doesn't mean that the overriding subclass'
exception takes the same risks. Bottom line: an overriding method doesn't
have to declare any exceptions that it will never throw, regardless of what the
overridden method declares.

* You cannot override a method marked final.

* You cannot override a method marked static. We'll look at an example in a
few pages when we discuss static methods in more detail.

* If a method can't be inherited, you cannot override it. Remember that
overriding implies that you're reimplementing a method you inherited! For
example, the following code is not legal, and even if you added an eat()
method to Horse, it wouldn't be an override of Animal's eat() method.

------Overloading
* Overloaded methods MUST change the argument list.
* Overloaded methods CAN change the return type.
* Overloaded methods CAN change the access modifier.
* Overloaded methods CAN declare new or broader checked exceptions.
* A method can be overloaded in the same class or in a subclass. In other words,
if class A defines a doStuff(int i) method, the subclass B could define a
doStuff(String s) method without overriding the superclass version that
takes an int. So two methods with the same name but in different classes
can still be considered overloaded, if the subclass inherits one version of the
method and then declares another overloaded version in its class definition.

-------Alta cohesión y bajo acoplamiento

Principios de un buen diseño:
	* Ease of creation
	* Ease of maintenance
	* Ease of enhancement

----Bajo acoplamiento:

Let's start by making an attempt at a definition of coupling. Coupling is the degree
to which one class knows about another class. If the only knowledge that class A
has about class B, is what class B has exposed through its interface, then class A and
class B are said to be loosely coupled…that's a good thing. If, on the other hand,
class A relies on parts of class B that are not part of class B's interface, then the
coupling between the classes is tighter…not a good thing. In other words, if A knows
more than it should about the way in which B was implemented, then A and B are
tightly coupled.

----Alta cohesión
The term cohesion is used to indicate the degree to which a class has a single, 
well-focused purpose. The more focused a class is, the higher its cohesiveness.
The key benefit of high cohesion is that such classes are typically much easier
to maintain and this classes with a well-focused purpose tend to be more
reusable than other classes.
